- 👋 Hi, I’m Nick!
- 👀 I’m interested in opportunities to explore nature, long-distance trail running/hiking, and most importantly building stronger bonds with family and friends
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Agentic UI principles, being mindful of my family and balance in personal activities, and being an advocate to creating successful products
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on human projects, advocating for user centered design, reusable design components to increase efficiency and spend more time doing what I love, solving wicked problems! 
- 📫 How to reach me ... nickolas.brock@gmail.com
